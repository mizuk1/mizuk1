## 🛠 Some Stuff I Built

### 🏫 MZKI Training Platform
A complete course and training management system built with Django, PostgreSQL, and Docker.  
Includes 50+ courses, advanced filtering, automated Saturday cohort scheduling, learning paths, seat control, and transactional email system.

### 🔎 AI-Powered Semantic Search
Implemented RAG using SBERT embeddings and LangChain for semantic document search inside the platform.

### 🎯 Course Recommendation API
Intelligent recommendation system secured with rate limiting and optimized queries.

### 🤖 LLM Agent Experiments
Conversational agents built with LangGraph exploring tool usage, memory, and decision nodes.
